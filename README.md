**About CodeChef**

CodeChef is a not-for-profit educational initiative by Directi, an Indian software company. It is a global programming community that fosters learning and friendly competition, built on top of the worldâ€™s largest competitive programming platform. We have also built a large community of problem curators.

CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms, computer programming and programming contests. We host three featured contests every month and give away prizes and goodies to the winners as encouragement. Apart from this, the platform is open to the entire programming community to host their own contests. Major institutions and organizations across the globe use our platform to host their contests. On an average, 30+ external contests are hosted on our platform every month.
